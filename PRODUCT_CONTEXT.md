# RankAndFile.gg - Product Context

## 1. High-Level Concept

**RankAndFile** is the ultimate proving ground for fantasy sports knowledge.

- **The Problem**: Talk is cheap. Everyone has a "sleeper pick," but nobody tracks who actually knows their stuff.
- **The Solution**: A platform to lock in your takes, track your accuracy, and finally settle who knows ball.
- **Philosophy**: Anti-algorithmic. We value human intuition ("The Eye Test") over black-box AI projections.

## 2. Core MVP Features

- **The File**: The user’s master ranking for a position (e.g., "My Top 50 RBs"). A drag-and-drop living document.
- **Continuous Ranking**: Users maintain their rankings indefinitely. No weekly reset (though snapshots can be taken).
- **The League**: A private group where friends can view each other's "Files" and see diffs/comparisons.
- **Visuals**: Focus on the depth of the list and the ability to find specific players easily.

## 3. Core Experience

- **The Ranking**: A drag-and-drop interface where "The File" is built.
- **The Comparison**: Instant visual feedback on how your "File" deviates from the consensus.

## 4. Design & Brand Vibe

- **Name**: RankAndFile
- **Tone**: "Receipts," "Bragging Rights," "Delightful," "Unapologetic."
- **Visuals**: Premium, clean, but with the energy of a highlight reel.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Avoid gambling aesthetics. This is about bragging rights and fun, not sweating bets.
