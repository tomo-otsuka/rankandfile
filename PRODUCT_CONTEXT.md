# RankAndFile - Product Context

## 1. High-Level Concept

**RankAndFile** brings fantasy analyst rankings to the masses.

- **The Problem**: Fantasy advice is dominated by "experts", but fans often know better. There's no way to prove it.
- **The Solution**: A platform where anyone can rank their beliefs, track their accuracy, and build a reputation based on results, not follower count.
- **Philosophy**: Democratize expertise. We validate knowledge through results.

## 2. Core MVP Features

- **Rankings**: The user’s master list for a position (e.g., "Season Long Top 100"). A deep, living document.
- **Depth**: We encourage ranking the field (50+ players), not just Top 10 lists. Real expertise is found in the later rounds.
- **Continuous Ranking**: Users maintain their rankings indefinitely. No weekly reset (though snapshots can be taken).
- **The League**: A private group where friends can view each other's "Rankings" and see diffs/comparisons.
- **Visuals**: Focus on the depth of the list and the ability to find specific players easily.

## 3. Core Experience

- **The Ranking**: A drag-and-drop interface where your rankings are built.
- **The Comparison**: Instant visual feedback on how your rankings deviate from the consensus.

## 4. Design & Brand Vibe

- **Name**: RankAndFile
- **Tone**: "Delightful"
- **Visuals**: Premium, clean, but with the energy of a highlight reel.
- **Anti-Pattern**: Avoid gambling aesthetics. This is about bragging rights and fun, not sweating bets.
